**2026-09-28 17:18.** Ken settled the last brief question: what the reviewer writes in one sitting is one edit, with no logic splitting new text out of it. He asked to finish the docs, so the architecture starts now alongside the wireframes.

**2026-09-28 17:16.** Ken finished reading the brief on its page. He answered the four questions:
- the agent writes the notes file
- lists are in
- rich paste is out, to the board
- larger edits fail the same way, so they are covered by the same requirements

He also leaned toward Tiptap as the engine. He gave steps for the doubled line after a header. He made three wording edits. Brief closed.

**2026-09-28 17:00.** The brief and crucible are now built with the feature-forge document builder, so the callout boxes render. The Docs links above point at the built pages; the earlier Markdown renders are retired.

**2026-09-28 15:41.** PM review returned eleven findings, all accepted: two blockers (the formatting bug had no reproduction and missed a board row; the brief pre-decided record shape and gesture), six important, three minor. Brief rewritten, clarity pass applied, served for Ken.

**2026-09-28 15:34.** Brief written from the accepted crucible. PM review dispatched.

**2026-09-28 15:33.** Crucible accepted. Ken chose approach B (a writing region that feels like today's edit mode), kept the formatting bug and note-taking in scope, and put Tiptap back on the table as an open architecture question after I had wrongly ruled it out on the dependency rule.
